# Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict stock prices based on historical trends. The model utilizes time series forecasting techniques and various machine learning algorithms to analyze stock market data and generate future price predictions.

Features

1. Data collection and preprocessing

2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

3. Feature engineering

4. Time series forecasting using ML models

5. Model evaluation and performance metrics

Technologies Used

1. Python

2. Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation

3. Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

4. Scikit-learn for ML models

Results

The model achieves competitive accuracy in predicting stock price trends. However, stock prices are highly volatile, and predictions may not always be precise due to market fluctuations.
